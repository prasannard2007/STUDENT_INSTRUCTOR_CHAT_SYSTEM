# STUDENT_INSTRUCTOR_CHAT_SYSTEM
Here is an repository that has student instructor chat system where it was made using Client-Server model to enable multipoint communication and there by server can respond to all the user in any manner ,because we have created an terminal  window using the xterm so it can handle  it and the client and server can talk without any interruption.
I have attached all the coding files and the output files that helps the users to directly visualize the ouput before referring to it .

USERS NOTE: This project is completley based on LINUX operating system , becaues i have use built in c libraries(API) that communicate with the LINUX operating system.
